## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a Rocket web framework skeleton that you can work with.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement a feature: `Notification`.
This feature will receive notifications of creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, when this receiver instance is subscribed to a certain product type.
The notification will be sent using HTTP POST request, so you need to make the receiver endpoint in this project.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Receiver" folder.

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    ROCKET_PORT=8001
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:${ROCKET_PORT}
    APP_PUBLISHER_ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8000
    APP_INSTANCE_NAME=Safira Sudrajat
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable                | type   | description                                                     |
    |-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ROCKET_PORT             | string | Port number that will be listened by this receiver instance.    |
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL   | string | URL address where this receiver instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_PUUBLISHER_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where the publisher instance can be accessed.       |
    | APP_INSTANCE_NAME       | string | Name of this receiver instance, will be shown on notifications. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)
3.  To simulate multiple instances of BambangShop Receiver (as the tutorial mandates you to do so),
    you can open new terminal, then edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` file, then execute another `cargo run`.

    For example, if you want to run 3 (three) instances of BambangShop Receiver at port `8001`, `8002`, and `8003`, you can do these steps:
    -   Edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8001`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8002`, then execute `cargo run`.
    -   Open another new terminal, edit `ROCKET_PORT` in `.env` to `8003`, then execute `cargo run`.

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Subscriber) Reflections

#### Reflection Subscriber-1

### Why do we use `RwLock<Vec<Notification>>` instead of `Mutex<Vec<Notification>>`?

In this tutorial, we use `RwLock<Vec<Notification>>` to synchronize access to the shared list of notifications. This is necessary because multiple threads might attempt to **read or write** the `Vec` concurrently (e.g., when receiving updates or when viewing the list of notifications via an endpoint).

`RwLock` is more suitable than `Mutex` in this case because it allows **multiple readers at the same time**, but only one writer. Most operations in this context are **reads**, not writes. Using `RwLock` improves performance by avoiding unnecessary locking when only reading.

If we had used `Mutex`, it would allow only one thread (either reader or writer) to access the data at a time, which could create a performance bottleneck, especially under high read traffic.

### Why does Rust not allow us to mutate static variables directly like Java?

Rust does not allow direct mutation of static variables because of its **ownership model** and **thread safety guarantees**. In Java, static variables are mutable and shared across threads, but the language does not enforce safe access — developers must handle synchronization manually.

In Rust, mutable static variables are unsafe by default, as they can lead to **data races** if accessed concurrently. To avoid this, Rust enforces that any shared mutable data must be explicitly synchronized using tools like `Mutex`, `RwLock`, or libraries like `lazy_static`.

The `lazy_static` crate allows us to safely initialize static variables at runtime and wrap them with synchronization primitives. This approach ensures that any mutation of global variables remains **safe and predictable**, adhering to Rust’s guarantees of memory safety and concurrency safety.
